## Devops 
- Open conversation on go-cdk vs python-cdk vs terraform

## Ed Catchup
- All systems are tightly coupled, we receive a stream of data from trunk of system, not each service, what we have is basically on dynamo. 
- Data is sent from Snowflake back into dynamo (?)
- Reliance on snowflake as solution for lots of things 
- Does this drive the refresh cadence? How we manage a reporting system is very different to how we manage operational system.
