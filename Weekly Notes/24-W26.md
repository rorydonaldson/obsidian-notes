## Pricing Team
- Lead by Andrew Harvey and Craig
- Alan Su is an analyst, uses Snowflake. Takes data, loads into a db that they own. Connects data robot to snowflake using a direct connection.
- Model gets loaded into earnix, which gets called by the pricing API
- Alan etc. has to download data from earnix, and loads data from snowflake to there, and data from earnix to snowflake. 
- All done manually, download csvs etc. 
- All tables etc created manually, use procedures that aren't in VCS, would benefit from shared knowledge, upskilling to analyst basics of dbt etc.
